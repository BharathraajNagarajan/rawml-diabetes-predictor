## 📊 Datasets

### 🗃️ `sample.pickle`

> A synthetic 2D dataset used for training and evaluating classification models.  
> It includes:
> - Training and test feature matrices  
> - Binary class labels  
>
> This dataset is ideal for demonstrating classification algorithms such as:
> - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
> - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)  
>
> It enables visualization of decision boundaries and model behavior in low-dimensional spaces.

### 🗃️ `diabetes.pickle`

> A real-world medical dataset comprising physiological and diagnostic attributes for predicting diabetes progression.  
> It contains:
> - 64-feature training and testing data  
> - A continuous target variable representing the diabetes severity score  
>
> This dataset was used to implement and compare multiple regression techniques, including:
> - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression  
> - Ridge Regression (Regularized Linear Regression)  
> - Gradient Descent-based optimization  
> - Polynomial Feature Expansion for non-linear modeling  
>
> It showcases end-to-end model development, from linear baselines to advanced regularized and non-linear techniques applied to health analytics.
